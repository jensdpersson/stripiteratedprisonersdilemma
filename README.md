# *Strip* Iterated Prisoners' Dilemma
This site exists to amend the [lack of strip versions](http://xkcd.com/696/) of the game theoretic problem [The Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoners.27_dilemma). The basic scenario is a slight abberation from the original. You can reload the game by choosing a new opponent. 

This has been live on http://www.jenspersson.com/stripiteratedprisonersdilemma/ some years now. Found the project again and thought I'd github it.
